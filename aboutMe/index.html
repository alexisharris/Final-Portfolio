    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p class="aboutMeText"> My name is Alexis Harris, and I am currently a graduating senior at CU Boulder. I am majoring in English Literature, while also getting my Secondary Education Licensure and a Minor in Creative Technology and Design (previously
      Technology, Arts, and Media).
      My current area of focus in Education is creative curriculum, with an emphasis on the student’s funds of knowledge that they bring into the classroom, beyond just the things they might’ve learned in it.
      I love learning myself, and love learning broadly, and that’s why I’m in 3 separate colleges at CU! It’s also one of the main reasons that I have decided to spend my life in a classroom. I strongly believe that I can learn as much from my students
      as they can from me. I am in my final round of student teaching at New Vista High School before I officially recieve my Colorado Teaching licensure in May of 2022.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeText">Currently I am working on a multidisciplinary project with the College of Arts and Sciences called the Collective to Advance Multimodal Participatory Publishing (CAMPP) with the faculty at CU Boulder. My focus in this internship is creating websites for the faculty to share their open education resources.
      My most recent previous project included creating and leading a student-led design challenge, the Sko Together Challenge, calling for undergraduate voices in solving the problem of connection within a pandemic.
      Finally, I am the Design Specialist for Mission Spark, a non-profit organization based out of Denver, Colorado. I work with Mission Spark and their partner organizations to create strategic planning visuals, company branding packets, and websites. Most recently, I have worked with the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region and the National Alliance on Mental Health.</p>

    <p class="aboutMeText">In between projects, I read when I can and spend time with family! Past that, I love keeping up with my Broncos and playing a pickup game of soccer.</p>
